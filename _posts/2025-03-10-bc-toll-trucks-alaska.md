The **British Columbia** government is drafting new legislation that could impose tolls on **trucks traveling to Alaska**, according to **Premier David Eby**. The proposed toll system aims to generate revenue for infrastructure maintenance while addressing environmental concerns linked to heavy transport. While details on pricing and implementation remain under discussion, the move is already sparking debate among trucking companies and cross-border trade officials. If approved, the toll could reshape freight transportation routes between **Canada and the U.S.**, with potential economic implications for businesses relying on this corridor.
